**To-Do List**
This is a simple to-do list web application built using html, css and js. 
Additional frameworks used include Bootstrap. The whole bootstrap file is not downloaded in the repo, and hence the reference is made from within the html file(i.e, index.html)
The Tasks are entered in the input area, after which they appear in the list.
On clicking the tasks which are active(normal state- representing a task still to be done), they become inactive(in grey color and a line-through text decoration. i.e- they represent a task which is done). Also, if the task which is clicked on is in inactive state, it turns to active state.
